v1.0 of EZBlocker silent

This edition will be modified to be as portable as possible and require as little user interaction as possible.

EZBlocker
=========

EZBlocker is a Spotify Ad Blocker. It started as a program that I quickly put together with VB.NET. The latest version is written in C#.

It uses non-intrusive methods to read the Spotify client to extract song information. This information is then cross-checked with the iTunes and Spotify libraries to detect whether or not the song is an advertisement. When an advertisement is playing, EZBlocker will mute Spotify and automatically resume playing regular music when the ad is over.

Because EZBlocker does not modify the Spotify client in any ways, it is less buggy compared to other ad blockers. The goal for EZBlocker is to be the most reliable and stable ad blocker for Spotify.
